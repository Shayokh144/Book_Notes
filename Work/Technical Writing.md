## Words

- Define new or unfamiliar terms within your document or link to existing definitions to ensure clarity for all readers.
- Use consistent terminology throughout your document to avoid confusion and ensure clear communication of ideas.
- Introduce acronyms properly by providing the full term followed by the acronym in parentheses, both in bold, and use them judiciously, especially for lengthy or frequently used terms.
- Minimize ambiguity by replacing or clarifying pronouns like "it," "they," "this," and "that" with explicit nouns or by placing them closer to their referents to ensure clear understanding.

## Active voice vs. passive voice
- The vast majority of sentences in technical writing should be in active voice.
	- Active Voice Sentence = **actor + verb + target**
	- Passive Voice Sentence = **target + verb + actor**
- Prioritize clarity in technical writing by choosing strong, specific verbs over generic ones like *be*, *occur*, or *happen*.
- Avoid starting sentences with "There is" or "There are" to improve clarity; instead, identify a clear subject and verb.
- Instead of vague adjectives or adverbs, use objective numerical data to maintain accuracy and credibility in technical writing.
- Replacing weak verbs and phrases with stronger alternatives ensures more engaging and informative technical content.
