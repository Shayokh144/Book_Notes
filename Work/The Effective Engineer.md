# The Effective Engineer 

## Chapter 1: Focus on High-Leverage Activities

- Among the list of tasks we need to find the important one to finish first. To find the most important task we can use below formula to calculate Leverage which is equivalent to **return on investment (ROI)** for the effort that’s put in:

***Leverage = Value, or impact, produced / Time invested***

- Three ways to increase the **leverage:**
    - By reducing the time it takes to complete a certain activity.
    - By increasing the output of a particular activity.
    - By shifting to higher-leverage activities.

## Chapter 2: Optimize for Learning

- Need to adopt a growth mindset rather than fixed mindset. 
- View failures and challenges through a growth mindset, and see them as opportunities to learn.
- Invest time regularly for learning or doing side project. Can follow 20% rule which states we should dedicate our 20% work time for learning.
- Learning compounds like interest. The more you learn, the easier it is to apply prior insights and lessons to learn new things.
- Capitalize on opportunities at work to improve your technical skills. 
- Learn from your best co-workers. Study their code and their code reviews. 
- Dive into any available educational material provided by your company, and look into classes or books that your workplace might be willing to subsidize

## Chapter 3: Prioritise regularly

*Prioritization is hard work, and like most skills, it requires practice. We need to work persistently on improving our prioritization skills. Taking the time and energy to prioritize will significantly increase your chances for success. Some strategies used to prioritize effectively*:
- **Track To-Dos in a single, easily accessible list.** The first step in effective prioritization is listing every task that you might need to do and prioritizing them, rather than relying on memory.
- **While prioritizing, ask yourself: Is there something else I could be doing that's higher-leverage? If not, continue on your current path. If yes, it's time to rethink what you're doing.**
	- To determine whether something else offers greater leverage than your current efforts, you can follow two key heuristics:
		- *Focus on activities that directly produce value. Prioritize those that yield the most value with the least effort.*
		- *Prioritize the important and non-urgent tasks. In addition to focusing on activities that directly generate value, consider prioritizing investments that enhance your effectiveness and enable you to deliver more value in the future.*

- Protect Your Maker’s Schedule. When possible, preserve larger blocks of focused time in your schedule.
- **Limit the amount of work in progress.**
	- When we fragment our attention too much, however, we end up reducing our overall productivity and hindering our ability to make substantive progress on any single task. Constantly switching contexts hinders deep engagement in any one activity and reduces our overall chances of success. Therefore, we need to be deliberate about limiting our work in progress. This involves prioritizing and sequencing different projects so that we can maintain a strong momentum.
- **Fight procrastination with If-Then plans.**
	- Many people do not have sufficient motivation to summon the activation energy required to start a difficult task. The 'if-then' plan, in which we identify ahead of time a situation where we plan to do a certain task, is essential. Subconscious follow-up is important because procrastination primarily stems from a reluctance to expend the initial activation energy on a task. This reluctance leads us to rationalize why it might be better to do something easier or more enjoyable, even if it has lower leverage. When we're in the moment, the short-term value that we get from procrastinating can often dominate our decision-making process. However, when we make 'if-then' plans and decide what to do ahead of time, we're more likely to consider the long-term benefits associated with a task.

- **Make a routine of prioritization**
	- As time passes, our current projects may no longer represent the best use of our time, so we need to make a habit of revisiting those priorities.


## Chapter 4: Invest in Iteration Speed

#### Why

- The faster that we can iterate, the more that we can learn about what works and what doesn’t work. 
- We can build more things and try out more ideas. [Not every change will produce positive value and growth, of course.]

#### How to optimize

#### Invest in Time-Saving Tools

- If we have to do something manually more than twice, then it is better to write a tool for the third time. There are only a finite num- ber of work hours in the day, so increasing our effort as a way to increase our impact fails to scale. Tools are the multipliers that allow us to scale our im- pact beyond the confines of the work day.
- Improve internal development tools.

#### Shorten Your Debugging and Validation Loops

- We can shortcut around normal system behaviors and user interactions when we’re testing our products.
	- We could navigate through the same three interactions that every normal user goes through: switching to the friends tab, choosing someone from our contacts, and then crafting an invite message. Or, we could create a much shorter workflow by spending a few minutes wiring up the application so that you’re dropped into the buggy part of the invitation flow every time the application launches.

#### Master Your Programming Environment

Mastery is a process, not an event, and as you get more comfortable, the time savings will start to build. The key is to be mindful of which of your common, everyday actions slow you down, and then figure out how to perform those actions more efficiently. Here are some ways we can get started on mastering our programming fundamentals:
- Get proficient with your favorite text editor or IDE.
- Learn at least one productive, high-level programming language.
- Get familiar with UNIX (or Windows) shell commands.
- Prefer the keyboard over the mouse.
- Automate your manual workflows.
- Test out ideas on an interactive interpreter. For example in iOS development test your logical code in Playground or Console app before tesing it in app environment.
- Make it fast and easy to run just the unit tests associated with your cur- rent changes.


#### Don’t Ignore Your Non-Engineering Bottlenecks

Non-engineering constraints may also hinder your iteration speed. 
- One common type of bottleneck is dependency on other people. A product manager might be slow at gathering the customer requirements that you need; a designer might not be providing the Photoshop mocks for a key workflow; another engineering team might not have delivered a promised feature, thus blocking your own development.
	- Communication is critical for making progress on people-related bottlenecks. Ask for updates and commitments from team members at meetings or daily stand-ups. Periodically check in with that product manager to make sure what you need hasn’t gotten dropped. Follow up with written communica- tion (email or meeting notes) on key action items and dates that were decided in-person.
	- Don’t wait until after you’ve invested massive amounts of engineering time to seek final project ap- proval. Instead, prioritize building prototypes, collecting early data, conducting user studies, or whatever else is necessary to get preliminary project approval.
