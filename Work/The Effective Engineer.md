# The Effective Engineer 

## Chapter 1: Focus on High-Leverage Activities

- Among the list of tasks we need to find the important one to finish first. To find the most important task we can use below formula to calculate Leverage which is equivalent to **return on investment (ROI)** for the effort that’s put in:

***Leverage = Value, or impact, produced / Time invested***

- Three ways to increase the **leverage:**
    - By reducing the time it takes to complete a certain activity.
    - By increasing the output of a particular activity.
    - By shifting to higher-leverage activities.

## Chapter 2: Optimize for Learning

- Need to adopt a growth mindset rather than fixed mindset. 
- View failures and challenges through a growth mindset, and see them as opportunities to learn.
- Invest time regularly for learning or doing side project. Can follow 20% rule which states we should dedicate our 20% work time for learning.
- Learning compounds like interest. The more you learn, the easier it is to apply prior insights and lessons to learn new things.
- Capitalize on opportunities at work to improve your technical skills. 
- Learn from your best co-workers. Study their code and their code reviews. 
- Dive into any available educational material provided by your company, and look into classes or books that your workplace might be willing to subsidize

## Chapter 3: Prioritise regularly

*Prioritization is hard work, and like most skills, it requires practice. We need to work persistently on improving our prioritization skills. Taking the time and energy to prioritize will significantly increase your chances for success. Some strategies used to prioritize effectively*:
- **Track To-Dos in a single, easily accessible list.** The first step in effective prioritization is listing every task that you might need to do and prioritizing them, rather than relying on memory.
- **While prioritizing, ask yourself: Is there something else I could be doing that's higher-leverage? If not, continue on your current path. If yes, it's time to rethink what you're doing.**
	- To determine whether something else offers greater leverage than your current efforts, you can follow two key heuristics:
		- *Focus on activities that directly produce value. Prioritize those that yield the most value with the least effort.*
		- *Prioritize the important and non-urgent tasks. In addition to focusing on activities that directly generate value, consider prioritizing investments that enhance your effectiveness and enable you to deliver more value in the future.*

- Protect Your Maker’s Schedule. When possible, preserve larger blocks of focused time in your schedule.
- **Limit the amount of work in progress.**
	- When we fragment our attention too much, however, we end up reducing our overall productivity and hindering our ability to make substantive progress on any single task. Constantly switching contexts hinders deep engagement in any one activity and reduces our overall chances of success. Therefore, we need to be deliberate about limiting our work in progress. This involves prioritizing and sequencing different projects so that we can maintain a strong momentum.
- **Fight procrastination with If-Then plans.**
	- Many people do not have sufficient motivation to summon the activation energy required to start a difficult task. The 'if-then' plan, in which we identify ahead of time a situation where we plan to do a certain task, is essential. Subconscious follow-up is important because procrastination primarily stems from a reluctance to expend the initial activation energy on a task. This reluctance leads us to rationalize why it might be better to do something easier or more enjoyable, even if it has lower leverage. When we're in the moment, the short-term value that we get from procrastinating can often dominate our decision-making process. However, when we make 'if-then' plans and decide what to do ahead of time, we're more likely to consider the long-term benefits associated with a task.

- **Make a routine of prioritization**
	- As time passes, our current projects may no longer represent the best use of our time, so we need to make a habit of revisiting those priorities.
