# The Effective Engineer 

### Chapter 1: Focus on High-Leverage Activities

- Among the list of tasks we need to find the important one to finish first. To find the most important task we can use below formula to calculate Leverage which is equivalent to **return on investment (ROI)** for the effort that’s put in:

***Leverage = Value, or impact, produced / Time invested***

- Three ways to increase the **leverage:**
    - By reducing the time it takes to complete a certain activity.
    - By increasing the output of a particular activity.
    - By shifting to higher-leverage activities.

### Chapter 2: Optimize for Learning

- Need to adopt a growth mindset rather than fixed mindset. • View failures and challenges through a
growth mindset, and see them as opportunities to learn.
- Invest time regularly for learning or doing side project. Can follow 20% rule which states we should dedicate our 20% work time for learning.
- Learning compounds like interest. The more you learn, the easier it is to apply prior insights and lessons to learn new things.
- Capitalize on opportunities at work to improve your technical skills. ****Learn from your best co-workers. Study their code and their code reviews. Dive into any available educational material provided by your company, and look into classes or books that your workplace might be willing to subsidize
